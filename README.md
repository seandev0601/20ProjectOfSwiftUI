# **20ProjectOfSwiftUI**


This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning SwiftUI through the 20ProjectOfSwiftUI challenge, as created by myself. The goal of this challenge is to build practical iOS applications.


## **Tools and Requirements**

To follow along with this repository, you will need the following tools and software:

- **[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)** 15.0.1 (or later)

## **Progress Tracker**

To track my progress through the 20ProjectOfSwiftUI challenge, I will update the following table with links to each project's code and associated project:

| Project | Topic | Key Point |

| [01](MealExpenses) | MealExpenses | TextField„ÄÅPicker„ÄÅSection |


Each project's folder will contain the completed code and any relevant resources for that specific topic.
